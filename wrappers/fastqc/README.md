Calls FastQC on input data sets (paired or not)

This wrapper takes 1 or 2 FastQ files as input. It creates a **fastqc.done**
file defined by the user. Result are stored in the directory extracted from
the output file name. In other words, if the output is defined as
fastqc/fastqc.done, results will be stored in ./fastqc directory.

Required input:

- one file or two files (if paired data)

Required output:

- **done**: a filename used as a trigger of job done. Be aware that the root
  directory of this file is used to store the results

Required parameters

- **options**: a list of valid fastqc options
- **working_directory**: place where results of fastqc are saved

Log:

- a log file generated by fastqc is stored
