    """Calls FastQC on input data sets (paired or not)

    This wrapper takes 1 or 2 FastQ files as input. It creates a **fastqc.done**
    file defined by the user. Result are stored in the directory extracted from
    the output file name. In other words, if the output is defined as
    fastqc/fastqc.done, results will be stored in ./fastqc directory.

    Required input:
        - one file or two files (if paired)

    Required output:
        - **done**: a filename used as a trigger of job done. Be aware that the root
          directory of this file is used to store the results

    Required parameters
        - **options**: a list of valid fastqc options
        - **working_directory**: place where results of fastqc are saved

    Log:
        - a log file generated by fastqqc is stored

    Required configuration section:
        .. code-block:: yaml

            fastqc:
                options: "-nogroup"   # a string with fastqc options
                threads:              # optional. if not set, 4 threads are used
