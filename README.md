# The Sequana Wrapper Repository

The Sequana Wrapper Repository is a collection of reusable wrappers used in Sequana Pipelines inspired from [Snakemake Wrapper Repository](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-wrappers/).

# Notes for developers

The wrappers directory contains the wrappers. Each sub-directory is dedicated to
a wrapper related to a given software/application. 

Here is an example a a wrapper tree structure:

    fastqc
    ├── environment.yaml
    ├── README.md
    ├── test
    │   ├── Snakefile
    │   ├── test_R1_.fastq
    │   └── test_R2_.fastq
    └── wrapper.py

Note that some software may have several sub wrappers (see the bowtie1 wrapper for instance).

So, a wrapper directory must contain a file called **wrapper.py** where the
developers must provide the core of the wrapper. There is no specific
instructions here except to write good code as much as possible.

A wrapper directory should have a **test** directory for continuous integration
with a **Snakefile** to be tested and possibly data file **Do not add large files here**. 
Finally, include your test in the main [**test.py**](test.py) file 
of the root of the repository (not the wrapper itself). 

For testing purposes, you should also add a file called **environment.yaml** 
to tell what are the required packages to be installed for the test (and wrapper) 
to work.

Finally, for the documentation, we kindly ask the developer to create a **README.md** file 
described here below. 

To test your new wrapper, type:

   pytest test.py -k test_example

## Notes about the config file used in sequana

- Rules may use the threads key, which can be defined in the general config file.
- the **params** section should contain a key called **options** also define in the config file of most pipelines.
- keys or parameters related to directories and files should use the *_directory* or *_file* suffices

Consider this example:: 

    rule falco:
        input: whatever
        output: whatever
        log:
            "samples/{sample}/falco.log"
        threads:
            config['falco']['threads']
        params:
            options=config['falco']['options'],
            wkdir=config['falco']['working_directory']
        wrapper:
            "falco/wrappers/falco"

## Documentation

Please see the wrappers/fastqc/README.md example. The file must be in markdown
format. It must contain a **Documentation** and **Example** sub sections. If a
**Configuration** section is found, it is also added to the documentation to be
found in https://sequana.readthedocs.io

See the [fastqc](wrappers/fastqc/README.md) directory for a workable example



## Faqs

When adding new recipe / testing, you may face several issues. 

Make sure you have added/commited the files you want to test.

Generally, you should create a branch, add the recipe. In the test file, when setting the wrapper
you should replace the first 'main' by your branch name and then you can test the wrapper locally as
follows::

   cd wrapper/your_recipe/test
   snakemake -s Snakefile  -j 1 --wrapper-prefix git+file:///YOURPATH/sequana-wrappers/ -f -p

Once it works, do not forget to replace the branch name in the test.Snakefile with "main"
